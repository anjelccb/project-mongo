Results are generated non-algorithmically by a team of profile builders who create pages for search terms.  Mahalo includes the most appropriate hand found links and information about for about 10,000 unique queries.  <\/p>\n\n<p>By 2008 the company hoped to reach 25,000 profiles.  Not unsurprisingly, search results are generated at a limited speed, because of the absence of an automated engine.  However, results pages are often very deep and useful.  Searching queries for which a page has not been created are supplemented with Google search results.  Theoretically, Google users shouldn&#8217;t have a problem switching over.<\/p>\n\n<p>Results pages are a mix between a traditional search layout and Wikipedia.  Any factual information is concisely listed to the side of the all links, while links results are split into different categories with the &#8220;top 7&#8221; heading up the page.  Results categories beyond the top 7 are decided upon by Mahalo guides.  These categories are tailored specifically to the search term.  Thus, a search for a person might include a professional profile, statistics for an athlete or a &#8220;gossip&#8221; section for celebrities.  Searches for companies generally include recent news, products or stock information.  Because search results are ultimately subjective, Mahalo allows users to submit their own links for consideration.  These links are voted on and eventually published or not.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although the manual creation process will force Mahalo to grow its index very slowly, founder Jason Calacanis claims the company can operate for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.techcrunch.com\/2007\/05\/30\/jason-calacanis-launches-mahalo-today-human-powered-search\/\" title=\"four years without any revenue\">four years without any revenue<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mahalo is one of a few substantially funded alternative search engines including <a href=\"http:\/\/crunchbase.com\/company\/powerset\" title=\"Powerset\">Powerset<\/a>, Hakia, <a href=\"http:\/\/crunchbase.com\/company\/wikia\" title=\"Wikia\">Wikia<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/crunchbase.com\/company\/chacha\" title=\"ChaCha\">ChaCha<\/a>.  <a href=\"http:\/\/crunchbase.com\/company\/wikipedia\" title=\"Wikipedia\">Wikipedia<\/a> can also be considered a competitor.<\/p>","phone_number":"","relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Calacanis","permalink":"jason-calacanis"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Roelof","last_name":"Botha","permalink":"roelof-botha"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"Ammons","permalink":"jeff-ammons"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Jeffrey","permalink":"mark-jeffrey"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Editorial Director","person":{"first_name":"C.K.","last_name":"Sample III","permalink":"c-k-sample-iii"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Social Media and Technology Guide","person":{"first_name":"Sean","last_name":"Percival","permalink":"sean-percival"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Rapp","permalink":"jason-rapp"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Social Media","person":{"first_name":"Darren","last_name":"Dodge","permalink":"darren-dodge"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Summer Associate","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Gurwin","permalink":"jason-gurwin"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Coffin","permalink":"matt-coffin"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director, Corporate Development","person":{"first_name":"Tyler","last_name":"Crowley","permalink":"tyler-crowley"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Community Manager","person":{"first_name":"Greg","last_name":"Cardoni","permalink":"greg-cardoni"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Jon","last_name":"Patricof","permalink":"jon-patricof"}}],"total_money_raised":"$21M","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.487267,34.017606]}}

The site allows people to create profiles so they can share memories and remember lost loved ones in a personalized way. Respectance lets you create a tribute to people who have died by uploading text, photos, and videos. With these features, family and friends have a common online space in which they can heal and remember. The site can be used to create tributes for anyone who has died, and so it is interesting to see that Respectance has a number of tributes for dead celebrities as well. With the availability of groups on the website, people can also find and connect with others who have experienced similar losses. There exist groups like &#8220;Just Lost Mom,&#8221; &#8220;Iraq,&#8221; and others so that people can heal together, offer support, and give advice. Ultimately, Respectance offers an honest service that aims to help people cope with death. Their revenue model is not based on advertising, but rather by charging money for extra services (for instance, it costs $1 to download a funeral video). As a niche social networking site, Respectance has certainly chosen to take on a unique market sector, and time will only tell if this is one that can work.<\/p>","phone_number":"","relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Board","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Derks","permalink":"richard-derks"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Todd","last_name":"Wilkinson","permalink":"todd-wilkinson"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Hans","last_name":"Koning","permalink":"hans-koning"}}],"total_money_raised":"$1.75M","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.321836,37.55909]}}

The company has built an orchestrated ecosystem of software, content and devices, all designed in harmony with the legendary BitTorrent protocol at the core. The BitTorrent Protocol, invented by founder Bram Cohen in 2001, makes massive files move efficiently over the Internet.<\/p>\n\n<p>Software\nThe original BitTorrent and the iconic \u00b5Torrent are the world&#8217;s most popular torrent software clients. They make it fast and easy for people to find, download, share, and play large files over the Internet.<\/p>\n\n<p>Content\nBitTorrent is currently building unique features to easily transform, play and share large personal media files (e.g. home movies, smartphone videos, and hi-res photos) with friends and on on BitTorrent partner devices. Through the Spotlight Artist program, users also have direct access to a library of artist-endorsed indie films, music, games and books.<\/p>\n\n<p>BitTorrent Certified Devices\nBitTorrent Certified devices extend the BitTorrent experience beyond the PC into the living room, home theaters, and smartphones. The BitTorrent Certified Devices Partner Program enables consumer electronics makers to join the BitTorrent community, reach a global audience, and solve fundamental user challenges with moving personal content to home devices.<\/p>\n\n<p>The BitTorrent Protocol\nThe global standard for delivering large files over the Internet. It enables faster file transfers by downloading pieces of a file from multiple sources and concurrently uploading pieces to other users, overcoming the asymmetrical nature of upstream and downstream bandwidth. Many companies, e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia and Blizzard, leverage the BitTorrent protocol to make files move faster.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b5TP or micro-transport protocol\n\u00b5TP is an intelligent BitTorrent protocol engineered to self-throttle when sensing network congestion, yielding capacity to priority traffic. The result? BitTorrent does not contribute to congestion on home networks or global ISP backbones.<\/p>\n\n<p>BitTorrent also contributes through more broadly-focused standards bodies like the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) at the LEDBAT working group http:\/\/www.ietf.org\/html.charters\/ledbat-charter.html. <\/p>","phone_number":"","relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Scientist and Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Bram","last_name":"Cohen","permalink":"bram-cohen"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Revenue Officer","person":{"first_name":"Rogelio","last_name":"Choy","permalink":"rogelio-choy"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Strategist and EVP","person":{"first_name":"Shahi","last_name":"Ghanem","permalink":"shahi-ghanem"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Klinker","permalink":"eric-klinker"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President","person":{"first_name":"Sandy","last_name":"Diep","permalink":"sandy-diep"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President, Sales","person":{"first_name":"Bob","last_name":"Reid","permalink":"bob-reid"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President Product Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"Morris","permalink":"simon-morris"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Hong","permalink":"james-hong"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Cadeddu","permalink":"john-cadeddu"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Product Marketing Manager, Mobile Products","person":{"first_name":"Annabell","last_name":"Satterfield","permalink":"annabell-satterfield"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Fredrik","last_name":"Neij","permalink":"fredrik-neij"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Ilan","last_name":"Shamir","permalink":"ilan-shamir"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"Ping","last_name":"Li","permalink":"ping-li"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Development - Content Initiatives","person":{"first_name":"Farid","last_name":"Fadaie","permalink":"farid-fadaie"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Communications","person":{"first_name":"Christian","last_name":"Averill","permalink":"christian-averill"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Doug","last_name":"Walker","permalink":"doug-walker"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President and Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Ashwin","last_name":"Navin","permalink":"ashwin-navin"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Mitchell","last_name":"Edwards","permalink":"mitch-edwards"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Vice President Engineering","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Pettitt","permalink":"john-pettitt-2"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Vice President, Certification","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Floyd","permalink":"michael-floyd"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Vice President of User Experience","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"G\u00c3\u00b3mez-Rosado","permalink":"david-gmez-rosado-3"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP, Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Jagadish","last_name":"Channagiri","permalink":"jagadish-channagiri"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP, Enterprise Services","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Hopper","permalink":"mark-hopper"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP, Consumer Services","person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Patterson","permalink":"eric-patterson"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Vice President, User Experience","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"G\u00f3mez-Rosado","permalink":"david-gmez-rosado"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Vice President of Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Mason","permalink":"matt-mason"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Vice President of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Claude","last_name":"Tolbert","permalink":"claude-tolbert"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Product Management Consultant","person":{"first_name":"Devin","last_name":"Poolman","permalink":"devin-poolman"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"UX Developer","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Velasquez","permalink":"robert-velasquez-2"}}],"total_money_raised":"$40.8M","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.394668,37.790998]}}

To put it into context, it&#8217;s a sort of cross between Digg, LinkedIn and MyYahoo. In a nutshell, its a social network that lets you find and share news based on your interests and location.<\/p>\n\n<p>One aspect of the service - each user has a customized Digg-like experience, effectively creating smaller niche versions of the popular social news site. That means niche publishers get to play, too. Today they are largely shut out of Digg. But popular stories from more obscure topics can get traffic traction through Mixx. Stories, video and photos can all be bookmarked.<\/p>\n\n<p>And Mixx hopes to partner with those publishing partners to provide easy bookmarking links back to Mixx. That will drive traffic back and forth, with both sides theoretically winning.<\/p>\n\n<p>Each user gets a customized home page with news items that Mixx thinks you&#8217;ll find relevant. There are also links to overall popular stories, as well as categorized stuff like business, sports and health. Users can also create and join topical based groups, which allow them to further refine the news they submit and receive.<\/p>\n\n<p>In April 2008, Mixx released <a href=\"http:\/\/www.readwriteweb.com\/archives\/mixx_launches_innovative_api_c.php\" title=\"an API\" rel=\"nofollow\">an API<\/a> that allows web services to view, submit, and comment on Mixx items and media.<\/p>\n\n<p>Amongst the newer social media sites Mixx competes with the likes of <a href=\"http:\/\/crunchbase.com\/company\/thoof\" title=\"Thoof\">Thoof<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.techcrunch.com\/2007\/03\/11\/spotback-launches-their-rate-everything-widget\/\" title=\"SpotBack\">SpotBack<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.techcrunch.com\/2006\/05\/17\/feeds-20-a-little-like-searchfox\/\" title=\"Feeds 2.0\">Feeds 2.0<\/a>.<\/p>","phone_number":"","relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Product","person":{"first_name":"Kerry","last_name":"Pearce-Parkins","permalink":"kerry-pearce-parkins"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Kip","last_name":"Frey","permalink":"kip-frey"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder \/ CEP","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"McGill","permalink":"chris-mcgill"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"Ross","permalink":"sarah-ross"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Mandelbrot","permalink":"david-mandelbrot"}}],"total_money_raised":"$3.5M","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.420926,38.003376]}}

Consumer Electronics &amp; Appliances Support information, Repair Service, Manuals &amp; Guides, Problems &amp; Solutions, Troubleshooting, FAQ&#8217;s History. <\/p>\n\n<p>Fixya was founded by an entrepreneur who decided to take advantage of the fact that consumer products manufacturers are not providing adequate support through their web sites. Although these products become more and more technologically advanced, their manufacturers are not allocating the necessary resources that are required in order to provide good technical support. Like any other consumer out there, Fixya&#8217;s founder had a hard time finding relevant and updated support information for his printer or digital camera, and therefore decided to create this site. The idea behind Fixya is to aggregate all support information that is scattered throughout the internet in a single user friendly location. <\/p>\n\n<p>In addition, Fixya is a huge knowledgebase that is constantly updated by a live community of users who share their experiences of technical problems and solutions. Through the site&#8217;s unique rating system, Fixya is allowing its users to find the best solution for every problem and even solve new problems. Over time, Fixya will offer the best solutions for the most common problems of each and every product that exist. <\/p>\n\n<p>The best thing about Fixya&#8217;s knowledgebase is that it&#8217;s based on real users&#8217; experience rather than on projected FAQs by the manufacturer. Website Users can get solutions to any issue with any consumer product by typing the name of the troublesome product or a brief description of their problem, and then clicking Search. Users can also browse lists of product manufacturers and recently posted problems. If users cannot find solution, they can click on ask button to post their question. Within hours they are other members within Fixya coming to rescue with a solution to the issue. The site also lets you search for repairmen in your area. <\/p>","phone_number":"","relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Yaniv","last_name":"Bensadon","permalink":"yaniv-bensadon"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Yoav","last_name":"Shilon","permalink":"yoav-shilon"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Member Of The Board Of Directors","person":{"first_name":"Raj","last_name":"Kapoor","permalink":"raj-kapoor"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Rami","last_name":"Beracha","permalink":"rami-beracha"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CIO","person":{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Cardella","permalink":"jonathan-cardella"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Sales","person":{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Vincelette","permalink":"ben-vincelette"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Product","person":{"first_name":"Yumio","last_name":"Saneyoshi","permalink":"yumio-saneyoshi"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP","person":{"first_name":"Yaniv","last_name":"Bar-Lev","permalink":"yaniv-bar-lev"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Marketing Director","person":{"first_name":"Dana","last_name":"Oshiro","permalink":"dana-oshiro"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP R&D","person":{"first_name":"Lior","last_name":"Leiba","permalink":"lior-leiba"}}],"total_money_raised":"$8M","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.323895,37.566879]}}

Over 100,000 media &amp; entertainment companies, enterprises, SMBs, educational institutions, service providers, platform vendors, and system integrators use Kaltura&#8217;s flexible platform to enhance their websites, web-services, and web-platforms with advanced customized video, photo and audio functionalities.  Kaltura&#8217;s features and products enable easy deployment of custom work-flows involving video creation, ingestion, publishing, management, syndication, engagement, monetization and analysis.

While the platform itself is free, Kaltura profits by providing a wide range of value added services to its platform users.  Our open source cost structure coupled with our large and fast growing customer base enables us to deliver these services at competitive pricing, and provide customer with several main benefits:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>No vendor lock-in - setting up a video platform and integrating it into existing workflows takes time and money, regardless of which platform you use - Kaltura is open source, so you&#8217;re not locked in with a certain vendor, you have full access to the source code and can always continue to use the code, and your time and effort will never be wasted.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>SaaS vs. On Prem - Kaltura is the only platform that can be deployed as a hosted solution (like the other platforms in the market), or as a self-hosted platform behind your own firewall. This provides full security and control for organizations that have an on premise deployment policy. You can also select a hybrid of the two, and migrate from SaaS to On Prem.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Application Exchange - Kaltura is the only provider that has an Application Exchange - a marketplace of add-ons, plug-ins, and applications that enhance the platform.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Highest level of: FLEXIBILITY - open source code that can be tweaked and changed according to specific needs.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Fastest pace of: INNOVATION - due to our global open source community of more than 10,000 members.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>EASIEST integration with existing systems - Kaltura&#8217;s platform is modular and designed to fit into your existing systems and workflows. We have both pre-packaged extensions for leading CMS and LMS systems like Drupal, WordPress, Blackboard, Moodle and many more, as well as custom integration solutions for authentication systems, proprietary CMSs, payment systems, and more.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Since its public launch, New York-based Kaltura has won numerous awards and endorsements, including the coveted TechCrunch40 People\u2019s Choice award, Mashable\u2019s \u2018Open Web\u2019 award, Microsoft\u2019s 2009 \u2018most promising Israeli web startup\u2019 award, AlwaysOn\u2019s \u2018top 250 startup\u2019 and \u2018top 100 media company\u2019 awards, LeWeb\u2019s \u2018top 30 web startup\u2019 award, the Open World Forum \u2018Open Innovation\u2019 award, Esquire Magazine\u2019s \u20188 most promising Web 3.0 companies\u2019, TV Week\u2019s \u20185 most promising video startups for 2009\u2019, and IDC\u2019s \u2018top 10 innovative application companies\u2019.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Kaltura&#8217;s customers and partners include media companies, universities, enterprises and SMBs and service providers.

Lenses can be about anything, such as ideas, people or places, hobbies and sports, pets or products, philosophy, and politics. Lenses aren&#8217;t primarily intended to hold content; more emphasis is placed on recommending and then pointing to content on the web. <\/p>\n\n<p>Users who create lenses are called lensmasters. A lensmaster uses the tools available online to provide links, feeds, abstracts, and lists to users who are trying to make sense of a topic. For example, a single lens could point to Flickr photos, Google maps, blogs, eBay auctions, YouTube videos, and other links.

The result: visually captivating presentations that lead your audience down a path of discovery.<\/p>\n\n<p>Prezi was officially launched in 2009 by co-founders Adam Somlai-Fischer, Peter Halacsy and Peter Arvai. <\/p>\n\n<p>Adam Somlai-Fischer is an internationally renowned architect and visual artist who has been working with zooming presentations since 2001. Adam found that a zoomable user interface (ZUI) enabled him to explore the &#8220;big picture&#8221; overview of a floor plan and then zoom into the detail of individual rooms. Because there was no commercially-available zooming presentation editor, each presentation had to be coded by hand. Audiences were wowed and approached Adam to discover what presentation software he used. A few persuaded him to give them access to his code. Finally, in 2007, Budapest University of Technology professor Peter Halacsy convinced Adam to develop an editor so that anyone could make zooming presentations. After creating a prototype, they recruited a business-minded entrepreneur, Peter Arvai, to join as CEO to help them build a product and a company. Prezi was launched in April 2009 from Budapest, leading to investments from TED Conferences and Sunstone Capital. The San Francisco office was established in November 2009. <\/p>","phone_number":"","relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Arvai","permalink":"peter-arvai"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & CTO","person":{"first_name":"P\u00e9ter","last_name":"Hal\u00e1csy","permalink":"peter-halacsy"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Joel","last_name":"Onodera","permalink":"joel-onodera"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & Head of Design","person":{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"Somlai-Fischer","permalink":"adam-somlai-fischer"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board","person":{"first_name":"Christian","last_name":"Lindeg\u00e5rd Jepsen","permalink":"christian-lindegrd-jepsen"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Braccia","permalink":"andrew-braccia"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Raconteur","person":{"first_name":"Kelly","last_name":"Hook","permalink":"kelly-hook"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Drew","last_name":"Banks","permalink":"drew-banks"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Andre","last_name":"Haddad","permalink":"andre-haddad"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Jack","last_name":"Mardack","permalink":"jack-mardack"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Team Member","person":{"first_name":"Tamas","last_name":"Kokeny","permalink":"tamas-kokeny"}}],"total_money_raised":"$14.3M","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[19.059078,47.490346]}}

As such, primary features include load balancing and load distribution tools, seamless world functionality, performance optimization tools, and an intuitive interface that is easy to learn and customize.<\/p>\n\n<p>NetDog has two major features.  First, NetDog is fully cross-platform - developers will be able to create games that can be played across PC, Mac, PS3, Xbox 360, and even iPhone.  Network messages will work regardless of the platform, bringing more gamers into each game, and providing unique gameplay options.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Second, NetDog&#8217;s architecture is built on a patent-pending distributed networking solution.  With small setting changes NetDog can be used in a variety of network topologies - from full client server mode to fully peer-to-peer, with a variety of network computing options in-between.

The company was started by two designers and two coders who set out to challenge the status quo and try to create a new way of building and maintaining data-driven sites. HammerKit 3.5, launched in 2007, introduced a new era of interactive web service building. By deploying a Software as a Service (SaaS) model we were able to offer our customers a complete online web design and assembly service. This gave the company a positive boost and set our vision as being the next generation web service design infrastructure. <\/p>\n\n<p>Things really started rolling for HammerKit in October 2008 as the company won the Audience Favourite and Best Company awards at the International MindTrek conference held annually in Tampere, Finland.

Users create Virsonas by building online life archives of facts, letters, journals, memories and photos and then invite family and friends to access and interact with their Virsona and its content. The more information that is added to a Virsona the more accurate and interactive that Virsona will be.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two different types of Virsonas. The first is your own Personal Virsona and the second is Community Virsonas. You can interact with Community Virsonas simply by clicking on the picture and chatting. To add information to an existing Community Virsona or participate in building a new one, you must create an account and log in.   <\/p>\n\n<p>A Personal Virsona allows users to establish a digital immortality by creating and building an interactive legacy and archive for people to communicate with and access for generations to come.

The conversation looks much like an Instant Messaging, or Text Messaging chat. Simply click on the chat box and type away. Consumers can also populate their Virsona with emails, video, photos, etc.  Through regular use of the Virsona, users can &#8220;train&#8221;\u009d their online self to act, &#8220;speak&#8221;\u009d and behave like they would in real life.

Shryk has developed the first three flavors, and these are directed at Youth (5 to 11 years old) Teen (12 to 17 years old) and Young Adults (18 to 24 years old.)  The system allows users to manage their own bank accounts and be trained in financial literacy at the same time. The Shryk system may be the silver bullet that has been missing in the battle against the issues the US is having with financial literacy. At the same time, we provide a business solution to the banking and credit union industries to start the customer for life paradigm with young kids in a way that provides a whole new set of products for the financial industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second half of this model is that Shryk provides access to the platform to schools and teachers for free, through the weProsper.org community site.  This allows a city to start kids in kindergarten with a simulated banking platform that looks exactly like what they will be able to use at a bank with real money when they choose. Not only does this enable schools to teach financial literacy on a sophisticated online delivery system for free, it also provides the onramp to drive new customers to our banking customers. The combination of both sides of this model is being hailed by many people in the financial literacy world as a possible breakthrough use of technology.  Shryk is enabling win-win public\/private partnerships between financial institutions, schools, and parents in a way that is financially feasible for all.

As such, primary features include load balancing and load distribution tools, seamless world functionality, performance optimization tools, and an intuitive interface that is easy to learn and customize.<\/p>\n\n<p>NetDog has two major features.  First, NetDog is fully cross-platform - developers will be able to create games that can be played across PC, Mac, PS3, Xbox 360, and even iPhone.  Network messages will work regardless of the platform, bringing more gamers into each game, and providing unique gameplay options.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Second, NetDog&#8217;s architecture is built on a patent-pending distributed networking solution.  With small setting changes NetDog can be used in a variety of network topologies - from full client server mode to fully peer-to-peer, with a variety of network computing options in-between.

The company was started by two designers and two coders who set out to challenge the status quo and try to create a new way of building and maintaining data-driven sites. HammerKit 3.5, launched in 2007, introduced a new era of interactive web service building.

Users create Virsonas by building online life archives of facts, letters, journals, memories and photos and then invite family and friends to access and interact with their Virsona and its content. The more information that is added to a Virsona the more accurate and interactive that Virsona will be.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two different types of Virsonas. The first is your own Personal Virsona and the second is Community Virsonas. You can interact with Community Virsonas simply by clicking on the picture and chatting. To add information to an existing Community Virsona or participate in building a new one, you must create an account and log in.   <\/p>\n\n<p>A Personal Virsona allows users to establish a digital immortality by creating and building an interactive legacy and archive for people to communicate with and access for generations to come.

The conversation looks much like an Instant Messaging, or Text Messaging chat. Simply click on the chat box and type away. Consumers can also populate their Virsona with emails, video, photos, etc.  Through regular use of the Virsona, users can &#8220;train&#8221;\u009d their online self to act, &#8220;speak&#8221;\u009d and behave like they would in real life.

Shryk has developed the first three flavors, and these are directed at Youth (5 to 11 years old) Teen (12 to 17 years old) and Young Adults (18 to 24 years old.)  The system allows users to manage their own bank accounts and be trained in financial literacy at the same time. The Shryk system may be the silver bullet that has been missing in the battle against the issues the US is having with financial literacy. At the same time, we provide a business solution to the banking and credit union industries to start the customer for life paradigm with young kids in a way that provides a whole new set of products for the financial industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second half of this model is that Shryk provides access to the platform to schools and teachers for free, through the weProsper.org community site.  This allows a city to start kids in kindergarten with a simulated banking platform that looks exactly like what they will be able to use at a bank with real money when they choose. Not only does this enable schools to teach financial literacy on a sophisticated online delivery system for free, it also provides the onramp to drive new customers to our banking customers. The combination of both sides of this model is being hailed by many people in the financial literacy world as a possible breakthrough use of technology.  Shryk is enabling win-win public\/private partnerships between financial institutions, schools, and parents in a way that is financially feasible for all.

However, this training is often ineffective or very expensive or both. <\/p>\n\n<p>Ineffective-Studies show that after 4 weeks, 85% of what was learned in a classroom setting is forgotten. Additionally, teaching interpersonal and communication skills in a classroom environment is rarely effective. Lastly, scheduling conflicts often cause inefficiency and delay in connecting a person in need of coaching and a coach. <\/p>\n\n<p>Expensive - Companies spend money on travel, lodging, meals and other related costs in order to get people to training sessions. Companies also deploy e-learning solutions which offer little or no interaction or practice and suffer from miserable completion rates.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, current market conditions have caused the majority of enterprises to cut training and travel budgets significantly and look for cost effective means to deliver training enterprise-wide.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Solution<\/p>\n\n<p>SureSpeak is a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider of web-based video coaching platform and tools. Executive coaches &amp; enterprises use SureSpeak to improve sales, presentation and communication skills leading to enhanced revenues, higher customer retention and improved operating efficiencies. SureSpeak users watch modeling videos that demonstrate desired performance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for example \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How to close the sale\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Then with just an internet connection and a webcam, the user records their version and self-reviews. Typically the user will re-record multiple times until satisfied (current record to save ratio is 6:1). Practicing or role-playing in a private setting has proven to be very desirable for SureSpeak users as opposed to group role-playing which is embarrassing and counter-productive. When the user is satisfied with his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153SureSpeak\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he saves, and his coach receives an automatic email alert notifying him that a SureSpeak is waiting for review. The coach then logs in from wherever he may be and whenever he has time. This is a key to the efficiency of SureSpeak. The coach provides feedback in written form, in score format \u00e2\u20ac\u201c based on customizable categories such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153body language\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tone\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enthusiasm\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153message content\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sincerity\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, etc. The coach also can record a video back to the user. When the coach saves his feedback the system notifies the user that his score SureSpeak has been reviewed, and likewise the user logs in when convenient to review. Additionally, each user can receive feedback from unlimited coaches, peers, managers, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>SureSpeak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patented platform is unique in that it is asynchronous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning the practice and coaching is split up into 3 distinct parts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c practice, coaching\/feedback, and review of feedback. These can be done independent of each other without delay and at any time. Most training fails in that no video record is provided and if it is not efficient or readily accessible online and cannot be shared. Synchronous training solutions such as video-conference fail as they still require both parties to be available at the same time.<\/p>","phone_number":"3128638950","relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder \/ CEO","person":{"first_name":"Darren","last_name":"Schwartz","permalink":"darren-schwartz"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Lou","last_name":"Friedmann","permalink":"lou-friedmann"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Technology","person":{"first_name":"Ilya","last_name":"Beyrak","permalink":"ilya-beyrak"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director of Customer Experience and Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Kristi","last_name":"Klemm","permalink":"kristi-klemm"}}],"total_money_raised":"$1.6M","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.632519,41.889183]}}

She was deciding between soccer and basketball. The website is very thorough and easy to navigate through. She updated her stats and personal information each season. We signed up for the MVP package so we could get more information on which coaches and colleges were interested in her.

BarterQuest? supports the cashless exchange of all types of goods, services, and the use of real estate. Our site allows people like you to realize the possibilities of getting stuff for stuff, of excluding the middle man, of avoiding the need for money to get what you want. Anyone who has anything that may be of value to anyone else, anywhere, can be a user of our site.<\/p>\n\n<p>BarterQuest is a journey back to the future. While barter is as old as man, the market for trading by individuals has remained a gray market, unreported and ill defined. The opportunity for the average person to trade goods or services has occurred only in the highly inefficient framework of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old economy,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d governed by limited trading options and serendipity. Yet with the advent of the Internet we can create a virtual marketplace with millions of individuals who have millions of items to trade. Now, for the first time, we have the means to mitigate the inefficiencies associated with trading. But how do you find your trading partner in this virtual marketplace of millions? Our users will be able to navigate this new marketplace easily and efficiently. BarterQuest? has patent pending, proprietary technology that differentiates it from other consumer trading sites. By aligning the haves and wants of our users, our Matching engine acts as a compass for the individual attempting to locate trading partners. Further, our technology significantly increases the probability and quality of a match with its ability to match the haves and wants of several users and close the loop on a multi-party trade; that is, I have what you want, you have what he\/she wants and he\/she has what I want. We believe our technology is essential to any trading platform designed to overcome the practical obstacles of manually finding and completing trades.<\/p>\n\n<p>We are excited about the possibilities for Internet based trading by individuals. We have all traded baseball cards, books, CDs and DVDs, stamps or coins, seashells and river stones, even the shirts off our backs. BarterQuest? enables traders like you to acquire clothing and accessories, the many things a baby or child may need, textbooks, electronics, professional services, timeshares, whatever, without paying cash. We sincerely hope that our site will have a positive impact on the lives of its users, making it easier for them to find the things they want and, at the same time, saving them money. We expect that our site will have a significant impact on how business is done and, by promoting trade, will conserve resources and help protect our planet.

In August 2006, Veeam launched their first commercial product: Veeam Monitor. This application allowed monitoring and resource management for VMware Virtual Machines (VMs). A month later, Veeam announced a new product called FastSCP - a free tool to create and deploy ISO-based backup copies of VMs. FastSCP became extremely popular and widely used. In 2008, Veeam successfully launched <a href=\"http:\/\/www.veeam.com\/vm-backup-recovery-replication-software.html\" title=\"Veeam Backup &amp; Replication\" rel=\"nofollow\">Veeam Backup &amp; Replication<\/a>. This innovative product supported fast file-level recovery and VM migration inside VMware environments. Future focus was on the development and marketing for Veeam Backup &amp; Replication. In 2010, Veeam Backup &amp; Replication won the Best of Show and New Technology awards in VMworld. Veeam\u2019s flagship product grew so quickly, it was used by more than 20,000 customers worldwide in 2011. Once Veeam Backup &amp; Replication v6 was released, Veeam expanded its business to Microsoft Hyper-V users. As Veeam continued to grow, so did the awards, such as in 2012 where Veeam Backup &amp; Replication won VMworld\u2019s Best Virtualization and Server Consolidation, Best of Show and Best Virtualization for Disaster Recovery awards.

The EmoSpark Cube is the first Artificial Intelligence console - it&#8217;s a translucent, android powered Wi-Fi\/Bluetooth cube that allows users to create and interact with an emotionally concise intelligence through conversation, music, and visual media. Over time, the cube creates a customized Emotional Profile Graph (EPG) which collects and measures a unique emotional input from the user. The EPG allows the cube to virtually \u201cfeel\u201d senses such as pleasure and pain; and \u201cexpresses\u201d those desires according to the user.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagship product, NxTop, combines centralized management with local execution on an enhanced Xen-based type-1 hypervisor that runs directly on end-user devices, delivering native performance and mobility. By running the workload on the PC, Virtual Computer enables companies to have centralized management without servers, storage, and networking required for server-hosted VDI. The technology supports shared image management, enabling an IT professional to manage thousands of desktops and laptops the same way that they would manage one.<\/p>\n\n<p>In March 2011, Virtual Computer announced its collaboration with Lenovo to optimize Virtual Computer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NxTop client virtualization and management solution on Lenovo&#8217;s business-oriented systems. These include select models of Lenovo&#8217;s ThinkCentre A and M series desktops and ThinkPad T and X series laptops.<\/p>\n\n<p>Centralized Virtual Desktop Management\nOne-to-many Provisioning. NxTop   provides  a central console for all desktop management activities. IT teams create and maintain a single virtual machine per operating system that can be published  to  thousands  of users. User-specific  personality, data, settings and applications are applied dynamically at each endpoint.<\/p>\n\n<p>Scalable Patching with Rollback. Patches and  updates are applied on a one-to-many basis. The IT administrator applies patches once to a master virtual machine. Upon republishing, the changed data is streamed to NxTop PCs running the virtual machine. A patched image is assembled in  the background and  transparently loaded on the next reboot.  IT can also easily rollback a patch.<\/p>\n\n<p>Integrated Security\nAES-256 Disk Encryption. All virtual machine and system data on NxTop- enabled PCs can be encrypted, providing peace of a mind in the event that a PC containing sensitive data is lost or stolen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Policy Controls. IT administrators can protect against data leakage and  unauthorized  use through a  robust set of policy controls.  Access to hardware such as  USB ports and network interfaces can be restricted  or filtered  based on centrally  defined policies at global, group, and individual-user  levels. Virtual machines can be  governed by time-based  expiration  policies and  on-demand remote disablement.<\/p>\n\n<p>Remote Termination  with  Data Destruction. As an added layer of security, IT administrators can flag lost PCs for remote termination. If  a  lost  or  stolen  PC  connects  to  a  network, it  is directed  to digitally  shred all data and  encryption keys, then self- destruct.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hassle-Free Data Backup and Restore\nTransparent Data Protection. Based on   centrally  defined policies, NxTop periodically initiates  data backup with no  end-user interaction required.<\/p>\n\n<p>Efficient Data Transmission. NxTop   backup  technology captures changes at the block level, transmitting only the blocks that have changed to NxTop Center.<\/p>\n\n<p>Advanced  Management for Distributed Organizations\nIntelligent Remote Office Caching. Downstream management servers may be deployed at remote offices to intelligently cache and distribute updates for more efficient bandwidth utilization.<\/p>\n\n<p>Local Backup Storage.  User data backups may be  localized at remote offices, speeding system recovery and  avoiding unnecessary strain on wide area network links.<\/p>\n\n<p>Remote Helpdesk. Simply  enable remote  support  from  the  NxTop  Center  console  for  immediate remote PC control \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even in the event of a catastrophic operating system failure such as a Windows \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blue screen of death.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d<\/p>","phone_number":"978-692-0933","relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"McCall","permalink":"dan-mccall"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Marketing Officer","person":{"first_name":"Sham","last_name":"Sao","permalink":"sham-sao"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Sales, Americas","person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"J.

(see below link)<\/p>\n\n<p>http:\/\/forums.networksolutions.com\/announcements-f4-new-partner-for-live-chat-t3074.html#entry13083<\/p>\n\n<p>First and foremost, ChatStat delivers direct 2-way conversation with your web site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visitors. What this means is that when people visit your web site, you can directly engage them, and ask them if they want help. If they say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes\u00e2\u20ac\u009d that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it, you are in a conversation with your site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visitor. In addition, if your customer wants or needs help, they can also seek an operator and get help at the most critical time.<\/p>\n\n<p>ChatStat and LIVELOOK.COM have also recently teamed up to provide in chat screen sharing, another industry first. This means that an operator can take over by remote control the visitors computer (with their permission), and provide support or &#8220;concierge&#8221; shopping services.<\/p>\n\n<p>ChatStat is also an instant messenger aggregator, a Voice Over IP Call Center system and dialer, and a unique site and operator performance analytics system.<\/p>\n\n<p>ChatStat is based on an instant messenger interface, much like AIM, ICQ, or MSN. This simple interface creates a tall and narrow window through which you can see your chat buddies. Buddies are defined as either people visiting your web site (who appear as numbers called IP Addresses), or as by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153handle\u00e2\u20ac\u009d they are known by on any of the instant messenger systems we support. Remember also, that other operators in your site, are also buddies. By double clicking on a buddy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name, you can then have a chat with them, look at previous conversations you have had, and other useful things. This provides many users with a comfortable, easy to understand, and familiar interface.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because both the live chat client and the statistics system run from a small floating instant messenger window, our software application does not take over your computer while you are using it. You can still continue to do other things and the ChatStat software will stay out of your way, even if you leave it open. It works in the same manner as many other instant messenger interfaces in that it occupies the far right side of the screen and docks with the desktop. It can also optionally be set to stay on top of other windows, be partially transparent, or only open if there is an event such as a chat request.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is where most instant messengers end, and where ChatStat begins. With ChatStat you get several additional major components that most instant messenger systems do not have. By combining the power of a live chat client, a messenger, a VoIP system, and a analytics program, ChatStat can merge these systems together into one capable of doing things that individually, no single program by itself can do. For example, providing statistics on your web site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traffic is great, and ChatStat does this, but it also is able to turn analytics to focus on Operator Productivity, Operator Popularity, Sales, Marketing, Conversion Rates, Return on Investment, AdSense Campaigns, and more! ChatStat will also display all of hourly detailed information using a patent pending technology called MovingGraph, that will let your graphs move.<\/p>\n\n<p>So what is ChatStat?

Even after you&#8217;ve created your application, it remains a template that you can easily customize with its graphical customization page.

KnowEm will not only help you secure your name across the vast social media landscape but we can also show you how to contact each site in order to have the name released and returned to you.<\/p>\n\n<p>To date the KnowEm team has helped to reserve over 500,000 profiles and reported back to some of our clients over 65,000 issues of squatting and misrepresentation of a brand, username or trademarked term. This is all done with local employees in New Jersey; we are proud to be a company fully staffed in the United States with absolutely no dependance on offshore outsourcing. Since security is one of our primary concerns, none of your sensitive information is sent overseas.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since April of 2009 KnowEm has been tracking and monitoring hundreds of social media networks populated mostly with user-generated content. Our database of networks is updated frequently as new sites are released and our staff reviews them for quality. We track multiple metrics on these sites to determine which networks are gaining (or losing) traction in the world of social media. By using and storing these metrics we watch for patterns and spikes in traffic and popularity.<\/p>\n\n<p>KnowEm also constantly updates and adds new sites to our vast database of social sites. The next Facebook, Twitter or MySpace is already out there or could be coming soon - do you know which one it will be? KnowEm offers a subscription service (Brand Protection Program) to ensure that you and your brand will not have to worry about it. As new sites emerge we will make sure that your flag is already planted and you will not have to worry about dealing with a squatter or someone who is misrepresenting your social media identity.<\/p>","phone_number":"800-691-5669","relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Streko","permalink":"michael-streko"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Barry","last_name":"Wise","permalink":"barry-wise-2"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Solis","permalink":"brian-solis"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Creative Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Matthew","last_name":"Inman","permalink":"matthew-inman"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Paige","last_name":"Craig","permalink":"paige-craig"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Siciliano","permalink":"robert-siciliano"}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[null,null]}}

Either path left IT professionals in a reactive, fire fighting posture that contributed to low organizational credibility for IT. Fast-forward to today and FireScope has delivered a third option.<\/p>\n\n<p>Just as ServiceNow and SalesForce previously disrupted the Incident Management and CRM markets through innovative use of cloud technologies, FireScope has done the same for the Enterprise Monitoring market.
